This was one of my first experemnts with javascript, jquery, and DOM. Iv'e removed the ads and decided to make the source code public.

If I were to do this again, I would create an elemnt class, whos attributes would be "number", "name", "symbol", and "weight". A list of these objects would replace the 3 arrays defined near the start of the file.
I would also seperate the validation functions and the parsinfg functions into thier own seperate files, as well as make the HTML more managable.

Iv'e learned a lot about programming since creating this, but for now I'm still happy with the outcome, and glad people are making use of this app.
